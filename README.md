# `while-e-coyote`

> An assignment with `while` loops.

## `number-summer.js`

In a file called `number-summer.js` file, write a program that continually prompts the user for numbers until the user enters the keyword `"done"` at which point the sum of all the inputted numbers is logged out.

#### Example

```
Enter some numbers (type 'done' when complete):
> 20
> 10
> 3.2
> done

Those numbers sum to 33.2
```

## `fibonacci.js`

Write a program, `fibonacci.js` that accepts a number, `n`, from the user and consequently logs the first `n` values in the fibonacci sequence.

The fibonacci sequence starts with 0 then 1. Each subsequent value can be obtained by summing the previous two values:
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...
```

#### Example

```
Enter a value for "n":
> 9

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
```

## `number-doubler.js`

Write a program that prompts the user for a number, then repeatedly doubles that number until it is greater than or equal to 100.

#### Example

```
Enter a number:
> 23

23
46
92
184
```

## `string-repeater.js`

Write a program that takes a string and 'repeats it' until the string's length is greater than or equal to 10.

#### Examples

```
Enter a string:
> abc

abc
abcabc
abcabcabc
abcabcabcabc
```

```
Enter a string:
> a

a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa
aaaaaa
aaaaaaa
aaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
```

## `make-divisble.js`

Write a program that prompts the user for two numberx, x and y. The program should add one to x until it is divisble by y.

#### Examples

```
Enter x: 
> 9
Enter y: 
> 1

9 is divisible by 1



Enter x: 
> 9
Enter y: 
> 2

9
10 is divisible by 2



Enter x: 
> 10
Enter y: 
> 3

10
11
12 is divisible by 3



Enter x: 
> 5
Enter y: 
> 4

5
6
7
8 is divisible by 4
```
